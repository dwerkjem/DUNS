# DUNS: Definitely Unnecessary Name Stack

## Overview
The **DUNS (Definitely Unnecessary Name Stack)** is a tech stack designed for rapid development of web applications, enabling them to transition seamlessly from MVPs to fully-fledged, scalable products. It focuses on providing a flexible, modular framework that evolves alongside your project, ensuring quick prototyping without sacrificing future growth potential.

## Philosophy
The core philosophy of DUNS is **pragmatism**. Start with the basics to bring your MVP to life quickly. As your application requirements grow, DUNS provides a clear path to enhance, optimize, and scale your application without the need to switch tech stacks midway. The stack grows with your application, reducing technical debt and ensuring a smoother development process.
